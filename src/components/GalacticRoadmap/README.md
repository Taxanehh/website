# Galactic Roadmap Component

A visually stunning, space-themed roadmap component that narrates your technical journey through animated planetary nodes and cosmic connections.

## Features

- **6 Milestone Nodes**: Each representing a major phase in your career journey
- **Animated Connections**: SVG path animations connecting the nodes
- **Interactive Modals**: Click any node to view detailed achievements and tech stack
- **Mobile Responsive**: Switches to vertical timeline on mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion powered entrance and hover effects
- **Cosmic Theme**: Matches the space exploration aesthetic of your portfolio

## Roadmap Phases

1. **The Launchpad** (2016-2020) - Academic Foundation
2. **Orbital Academy** (2019-2021) - Skill Mastery
3. **First Mission** (2020-2022) - Software Engineer Role
4. **AI Discovery** (2021-2023) - ML Integration
5. **Command Center** (2022-Present) - Senior Engineer Leadership
6. **Galactic Explorer** (2024-Future) - Innovation Pioneer

## Terminal Integration

The roadmap can be accessed via the `/roadmap` command in the hero section terminal, which smoothly scrolls to this section.

## AI Image Generation Prompts

Each node includes MidJourney-style prompts for generating custom space-themed visuals:

- **Launchpad**: "Futuristic space launch pad with glowing blue energy, cosmic background, minimalist sci-fi style"
- **Orbital Academy**: "Orbital space station with purple energy rings, advanced technology, floating in cosmic void"
- **First Mission**: "Spaceship on first mission through nebula, green energy trails, exploration theme"
- **AI Discovery**: "AI consciousness awakening in space, golden neural networks, cosmic intelligence"
- **Command Center**: "Commanding space station with red energy core, multiple docking bays, leadership hub"
- **Galactic Explorer**: "Majestic space explorer ship venturing beyond known galaxies, violet cosmic energy"

## Customization

The roadmap data is self-contained within the component and can be easily modified to reflect different career milestones, technologies, or achievements. Each node supports:

- Custom positioning (x, y coordinates)
- Different sizes (medium, large, xlarge)
- Unique glow colors
- Achievement lists
- Technology stacks
- Custom icons/emojis

## Dependencies
